# Whoami

Welcome to my page! I'm Toni, a Spanish Sys Admin with a focus on Cybersecurity. I have completed Higher Technician Certificate programs in telecommunications (STI) and computer system administration (ASIR), and I'm currently enrolled in a Specialization Course in Cybersecurity (CETI) which I will complete in May 2023.  

I created this blog to document my learning journey and share my experiences with others. I believe that by documenting my progress I can reinforce my knowledge and contribute to the cybersecurity community. Additionally, I hope to use this blog as a way to stay organized and keep track of my learnings and updates as a cybersecurity professional.  

I've decided to stick to English on this page for two main reasons: Reach and practice.  
However, I might translate some content to Spanish if there's little availability  (and I have time!) on the topic in Spanish, and will also upload some of my previous work in Spanish. 

# PingMe
Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find it helpful and informative.  
If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact). I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as possible.

## Disclaimer

This is still a work under construction! I'm still finishing my studies and trying to find a job so I can't dedicate as much time as I'd like to this project yet.
