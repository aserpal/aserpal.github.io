## NIST 

The National Institute of Standards and Techonology of the U.S.A develops [cybersecurity standards](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), [guidelines](https://www.nist.gov/risk-management), best practices and other resources. Keep up in with their [Publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp)!

## CISA

[The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/) is a U.S. government agency that is responsible for protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. They too offer [guidelines](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cyber-essentials)  and many other [resources](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources?search=insights&sort_by=date).

## SANS

[SANS](https://www.sans.org) is a collaborative professional organization offering training, certification, and research in cybersecurity. They offer a lot of good resources such as [articles](https://www.sans.org/white-papers/?msc=footer-secondary-nav)  and guidelines like [SANS Critical Security Controls]( https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/) - A prioritized set of actions to protect against the most common cyber attacks.

## ISO

The [International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org) is a non-governmental organization that develops and publishes international standards for various industries and sectors, including cybersecurity.  
Some Cybersecurity related resources are:

[ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html): A standard for information security management systems (ISMS) that specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS.

[ISO/IEC 27002](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27002-information-security.html): A code of practice for information security management that provides guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization.

[ISO 31000](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html/): A standard for risk management that provides guidelines, principles, and a framework for managing risks faced by organizations. It can be applied to all types of risks, including those related to cybersecurity.

## MITRE

[MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) is a non-profit organization that works with government, industry, and academia to address complex challenges in cybersecurity and other fields. They offer a wealth of resources and tools, including:

[Mitre ATT&CK® Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/): A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It can be used by cybersecurity practitioners to understand and prevent cyber attacks.

[11 Strategies for a World-Class Cybersecurity Operations Center (SOC)](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publications/white-papers/11-strategies-for-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center-soc): A white paper that outlines key strategies for building a successful cybersecurity operations center.

[Mitre Engenuity® Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://www.mitre-engenuity.org/center-for-threat-informed-defense/): A resource center that provides insights and resources to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture.

## PenTest Standard
[PenTest Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) is a community-driven project that aims to provide a framework for conducting a comprehensive penetration test. The website is an excellent resource for anyone looking to conduct a penetration test, whether they are a beginner or an experienced professional.  
[Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines): The PTES is a framework for conducting penetration testing. It provides a standardized methodology for performing and reporting on penetration testing engagements. The framework consists of seven phases, including pre-engagement interactions, intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting.  
[PTES Technical Guidelines](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines): The PTES Technical Guidelines provide a detailed description of the technical aspects of penetration testing. This includes information on how to plan, execute, and report on different types of penetration tests, such as network, web application, wireless, and mobile application testing. The guidelines also cover topics such as tool selection, exploitation techniques, and post-exploitation activities.  
[PTES Reporting Guidelines](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Report_Template): The PTES Reporting Guidelines provide a template for reporting the results of a penetration testing engagement. The template includes sections for executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations. By using this template, penetration testers can ensure that their reports are consistent and meet the needs of their clients.  
[PTES Code of Ethics](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Code_of_Ethics): The PTES Code of Ethics provides guidelines for ethical behavior during penetration testing engagements. The code emphasizes the importance of obtaining proper authorization before conducting tests, respecting the confidentiality of client data, and minimizing the impact of testing on production systems. The code also includes guidelines for disclosing vulnerabilities and reporting findings.
